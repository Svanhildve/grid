# Grid
This is a CSS grid I created from scratch with guidelines from some tutorial that I can't remember where I found (but will try to find!). 

I made some changes to this grid while using it in a project, but haven't rolled that back into the base yet.

# Disclamier
I'm a designer, and there are probably better ways to do this. Don't trust my code.
