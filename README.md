# SCSS Grid
This is a CSS grid I created from scratch while following the tutorial at http://j4n.co/blog/Creating-your-own-css-grid-system.

I have made some enhancements to the code after completing the tutorial - the main one being how I've changes it from plain CSS to SCSS. Each column is now being calculated through the use of for-loops, and the breakpoints are set as variables. There are still a few additions to this code that haven't been rolled back into the base yet, but that will happen sometime in the future.

I'm a designer, and there are probably better ways to do these things. Don't trust my code - if you use it and it gives you a headache, I will take no responsibility whatsoever. Try painkillers.
